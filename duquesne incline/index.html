    <span>Take a step back in time on a century-old cable car and see the 
        best views of downtown Pittsburgh while riding one of the few 
        remaining inclines in the country. Opened on May 20, 1877, the 
        Duquesne Incline was rescued and restored by a group of local 
        residents in 1963 and still delights residents and visitors with 
        its original, elegant, wooden cable cars. Now you can visit the 
        interior of the incline and watch the machinery while it operates. 
        The Duquesne Incline's upper station houses a museum of Pittsburgh 
        history, including photos and a storehouse of information on inclines
         from around the world. Unusual Pittsburgh souvenirs, maps and photos
          can be found at the gift shop.
